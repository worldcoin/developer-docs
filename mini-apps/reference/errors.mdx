|------|-------------|-------------|
| `verification_rejected` | User rejected the World ID request in World App. | If this was a mistake, trigger the verify command again. |
| `max_verifications_reached` | This person has already verified for this particular action the maximum number of times allowed. | Nothing to do. User cannot verify for this action again. |

Other helpful things
1. If you get a GS026 error, it means the signature is not valid. Most likely there's something switched in your args vs your permit. Double check each argument usually this is the nonce and timestamp getting mixed up.
