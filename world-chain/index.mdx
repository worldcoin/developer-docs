World Chain is a blockchain for humans. World chain offers several unique primitives:

-   Free gas fees for all verified humans
-   Native mobile distribution to all World App users through [mini-apps](/mini-apps)
-   Simplified crypto transactions [through mini apps](/mini-apps/commands/verify)
-   Sybil resistance for developers via [World ID](/world-id)
-   Airdrop of WLD tokens to all verified humans

These primitives enable World Chain builders to build never before possible applications and reach a global audience.

World Chain is built on the [Superchain](https://docs.optimism.io/superchain/superchain-explainer).
