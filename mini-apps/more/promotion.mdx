Mini Apps is a powerful distribution channel. To help the ecosystem grow, we will be introducing 3 programs to help you get started.

## App of the Week

Each week we will highlight a different mini app that showcases an outstanding usecase and developer effort.
This will be featured on the Worldcoin Mini Apps homepage and in the Worldcoin Mini Apps app. Learn about how we evaluate which apps to feature,
and how you can increase your chances of being selected.
