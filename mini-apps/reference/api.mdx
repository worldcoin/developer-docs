## Send Notification

<ParamField path="method" type="POST">
  https://developer.worldcoin.org/api/v2/minikit/send-notification
</ParamField>

This endpoint lets you send localized notifications to users of your mini app and requires an `api_key`.

### How do localizations work?

The user's language is available to you when they access your mini app
(via [Navigator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/language)).

All you need to do is provide localizations. Our backend will automatically infer which language is preferred by the user.
Currently we support only a subset of languages, with plans to expand. Find the entire list [here](/mini-apps/reference/api#supported-languages).
You can only specify languages that we support.

- If a user prefers a language that we don't currently support, we will deliver the notification in English.
- If you don't specify a localization for the user's preferred language, the notification will not be delivered.
  The response will include a specific `reason` to inform you of this.

### Body Params

You are required to either specify both `title` and `message` OR `localisations`.

<ParamField body="wallet_addresses" type="string[]" required>
  The `wallet_addresses` is an array of wallet addresses to send the
  notification to. Users must have opted in to notifications for your app. Max
  1000 users per call.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="title" type="string" required>
  The `title` is the title of the notification. It should be 30 characters or
  less. May contain emojis.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="message" type="string" required>
  The `message` is the message of the notification. It should be 200 characters
  or less. You can include the special variable `${username}` in your message,
  which will be replaced with the actual username of the recipient when the
  notification is delivered.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="mini_app_path" type="string" required>
  The `mini_app_path` is the url encoded path of the mini app where your
  notification should link to when the user clicks on it. Should be of the
  format `worldapp://mini-app?app_id=[app_id]&path=[path]` (path is optional).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="app_id" type="string" required>
  The `app_id` is the identifier of the app initiating the transaction.
</ParamField>

### Request Headers

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  The `Authorization` header should be the `api_key` for your app from the
  Developer Portal. Make sure to prefix it with `Bearer {api_key}`.
</ParamField>

<CodeGroup title="Request">
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://developer.worldcoin.org/api/v2/minikit/send-notification" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_key}" \

```

```javascript

  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer {api_key}",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    app_id: "app_id",
    wallet_addresses: ["0x123", "0x456"],
