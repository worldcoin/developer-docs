Integrate Apple Pay and Google Pay into your mini-app

<Note>
  Both Apple Pay and Google Pay run directly in the WebView environment of your
  mini-app, using their respective JavaScript APIs.
</Note>

## Environment Setup

First, ensure your mini-app has a secure HTTPS environment, as both Apple Pay and Google Pay require it.

## Limitations and Considerations

- **Platform Restrictions**: Apple Pay only works on iOS/macOS devices with Safari, while Google Pay is primarily for Android
- **Device Support**: Users must have devices that support these payment methods
- **WebView Context**: Some features might behave differently in the mini-app WebView compared to a standard browser

<Warning>
  For Apple Pay merchant validation, your server needs to be accessible via
  HTTPS and properly configured with Apple's developer portal.
</Warning>
