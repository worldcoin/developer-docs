title: "Unique Features"
---

World Chain is built on the OP Stack and is part of the Superchain, it uses the EVM for execution and Ethereum for data availability and finality.
These are standard properties of all Superchain networks, however, there are several features that make World Chain unique. World Chain is a network
built for unique humans and its features reflect that.

## Priority Blockspace for Humans

While it's open for everyone, World Chain was designed to prioritize anonymously verified human interactions over bots and AI through direct protocol integrations
 with [World ID](https://world.org/world-id) for proof-of-human verification. One of the initial protocol integrations being worked on is Priority Blockspace for Humans (PBH).
PBH enables verified users to execute transactions guaranteeing top of block inclusion, enabling a more frictionless user experience.
PBH ensures that ordinary users aren't unfairly disadvantaged by automated systems, greatly mitigates the impact of [MEV](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/) attacks and exploits,
and reduces the need to pay significant gas fees to be included in a block. PBH also enables future flexibility, allowing for a separate EIP-1559-style
market for human transactions.

If you want to learn the details of how Priority Blockspace for Humans will work, please read the [World Blog PBH article](https://world.org/blog/engineering/introducing-pbh-priority-blockspace-for-humans).

## Gas Allowance for Humans

Not only do humans get priority inclusion on World Chain through PBH, but they also will have a gas stipend to transact on World Chain for free.
Initially the stipend to fund this gas allowance will be provided by the [World Foundation](https://worldcoin.foundation) with the goal of progressive
decentralization allowing World governance to set it.

There are two main approaches to implement the gas allowance, one option is on the app/wallet level through the use of account abstraction and the other one 
is to set it at the OP Stack level through sequencer reimbursements or separate fee markets for unique humans where unique humans are not charged or their fees are paid for
by non-human transactions in the mempool which are executed by the sequencer. The simplest one is to implement a World ID gatekept [EIP4337](https://www.erc4337.io/) [paymaster](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-paymaster)
where each `userOp` or group of `userOps` per user requires a World ID proof. More details on gas allowance for humans coming soon.
