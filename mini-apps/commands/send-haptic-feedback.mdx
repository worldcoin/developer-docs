title: "Send Haptic Feedback"
---

Send Haptic Feedback is our command that lets you create more immersive experiences, by providing tactile feedback to users.
This command is available from minikit 1.7.1 and World App 2.8.7602 onwards.
Haptic feedback can improve the user experience by:

-   **Enhancing Responsiveness**: Immediate tactile feedback makes interactions feel faster and more satisfying.
-   **Improving Accessibility**: Haptics can help users with visual impairments by providing an additional layer of feedback.
-   **Increasing Engagement**: Users are more likely to enjoy and continue using apps that feel interactive and responsive.
