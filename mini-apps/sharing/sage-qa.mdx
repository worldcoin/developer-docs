## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Sage Developer project

Go to the [Sage Developer dashboard](https://dev-dashboard-gamma.vercel.app) and sign in. Create a new project.

### 2. Customizing Sage to fit your app

With a project created, head over to the project's settings, this page is accessible by going into: **Apps > Your App > Settings**. (Navigation is available through the menu bar on the top right or the top left breadcrumbs)

In this page you can find parameters to fine tune Sage to best interact with your users in the context of your app, a comprehensive description of these parameters is present [below](#app-settings).

### 3. Integrating Sage Support in your app

The final step to integrating Sage Support into your React application is to install and make use of the `SageSupport` component.

Add the npm package with the command:

```bash
npm install sage-support
```

Once the dependency installed, the simplest way to integrate Sage Support is:

```tsx
import { SageSupport } from "sage-support";

<SageSupport projectId={YOUR_APP_ID} />;
```

Where `YOUR_APP_ID` is the App ID (number) you can find in the [Sage Developer Dashboard](https://dev-dashboard-gamma.vercel.app) (top right).

More configuration options for the component are available [below](#sage-support-component).

### 4. Sage Support Link

Generate your app's Support Link using the [Support Link wizard](#support-link-generator) and use it as the Support URL under **Worldcoin Developer > Mini App > Configuration > App Store > Support > Link**.

### Analytics

Once you've started using Sage Support in your Mini App, analytics are also available in the [Sage Developer Dashboard](https://dev-dashboard-gamma.vercel.app), allowing you to identify the usage of Sage Support in your app and understand how users are using it. You can find more information about analytics [below](#app-analytics).

<Note>
  This is all you need to get Sage Support working. If you wish to customize it
  further, or better understand the various parameters continue reading below.

## App Settings

Located at **Apps > Your App > Settings**, the Settings page allows you to fine tune the Sage Support assistant to meet the needs and context of your Mini App.

### `App Name`

This name only lives in the [Sage Developer dashboard](https://dev-dashboard-gamma.vercel.app) universe and serves the purpose of differentiating between multiple Sage Support integrations, it's recommended that this field is set accordingly.

### `App ID`

Uniquely identifies your Sage Developer App and is used to link your `SageSupport` component to the [Sage Developer dashboard](https://dev-dashboard-gamma.vercel.app). This field is automatically generated and cannot be changed.

### `Introduction Message`

Defines the first message to be sent by the Sage assistant once a new chat is created/open by a user. This field is also capable of encompassing a custom variable (`%USER%`) which Sage will replace by the user's username.

### `App Description`

Provide a solid description about your app and what it focuses on, this field is processed by Sage as an additional context parameter, and is useful to keep the assistant behavior and subject within the landscape of your Mini App.

## Support Link

You can also integrate Sage Support directly into your World Mini App by using a Support Link. This allows your users to access Sage's AI-powered support without requiring you to install any additional packages or components.

The Support Link is a quick action URL that opens the Sage Support chat interface directly within the World App. When users click on this link, they'll be able to ask questions and get support related to your Mini App.

This link is particularly useful for developers to use Sage as their Mini App's native Support link, available under **Worldcoin Developer > Mini App > Configuration > App Store > Support > Link**

### Base URL & Parameters

The base URL to access a support chat is:

`https://worldcoin.org/mini-app?app_id=app_5dee2f19cd6eef599eb6ab275a0a7523&path=/support-chat`

This support link, akin to the [`SageSupport` component](#sage-support-component), accepts and requires some parameters to be passed, in this case URL Query Parameters, for the Support Chat to work like expected.

<ParamField path="devProjectId" type="number" required>
    Links your Support Link to your Sage Developer project, used for analytics and behavior.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="devReturnURI" type="string">
    Allows you to make use of the return button on the top left of the Sage Support chat window by passing a Mini App quick atcion URI/URL. Due to some encoding functionalities and implementation caveats, the value to be passed to this parameter has to be formatted accordingly beforehand:

    1. The URL must be submitted to a [UTF-8 encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent).

    2. All ampersand characters (such as the one in `&path`) have to be replaced with the sequence `(amps)`.

    To make this process easier, you can make use of the generator below or inside the [Sage Developer Dashboard](https://dev-dashboard-gamma.vercel.app). Any URIs outside of the `worldcoin.org/mini-app` space are not allowed.

</ParamField>

### Support Link Generator

<Note>
  The Support Link Generator component would be inserted here in the actual
  implementation.
