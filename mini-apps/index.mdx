Mini apps enable third-party developers to create native-like applications within World App.
Building a mini app will provide access to our rapidly growing user network and monetization opportunities via WLD and USDC.
In addition, mini apps introduce smart contract support natively inside of World App.

## How it Works

Mini apps are simply web applications opened via webview inside of World App. Using the MiniKit SDK, these applications can become
native-like and interact with the World ecosystem.
